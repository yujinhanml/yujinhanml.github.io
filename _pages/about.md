About Me
======

I am currently a second-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), where I have the privilege of being supervised by [Prof.Difan Zou](https://difanzou.github.io). Before joining HKU, I obtained my Master's degree from Yale University, where I was fortunate to be mentored by [Prof.Leying Guan](https://campuspress.yale.edu/lguan) and collaborating closely with [Prof.Sten H. Vermund](https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/sten-vermund/). I also hold a Bachelor's degree from Renmin University of China (RUC). Here is my [CV](https://github.com/yujinhan98/yujinhan98.github.io/blob/master/yujin_CV_2023.pdf).

I maintain a curiosity for any challenging research topics in machine learning and deep learning, exploring them with the aim of proposing principled methods and providing insightful understanding that can benefit the public.
