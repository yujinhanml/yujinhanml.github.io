About Me
======

I am currently a third-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), where I have the privilege of being supervised by [Prof.Difan Zou](https://difanzou.github.io). Before joining HKU, I obtained my Master's degree from Yale University, where I was fortunate to be mentored by [Prof.Leying Guan](https://campuspress.yale.edu/lguan) and collaborating closely with [Prof.Sten H. Vermund](https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/sten-vermund/). I also hold a Bachelor's degree from Renmin University of China (RUC). Here is my [CV](https://github.com/yujinhan98/yujinhan98.github.io/blob/master/yujin_CV_2023.pdf).

Iâ€™m deeply curious about challenging problems in generative modeling, especially image and video generation, and I explore them with the goal of offering insights and proposing principled methods that benefit the public. Recently, my work has focused on understanding and advancing unified multimodal LLMs.
